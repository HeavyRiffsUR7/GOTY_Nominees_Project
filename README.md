# 🎮 GOTY_Nominees_Project

This project builds a structured dataset of **Game of the Year (GOTY) nominees** and explores key trends behind award recognition in the gaming industry.  
The goal is to create a reproducible pipeline for collecting, organizing, and analyzing nomination data across multiple years.

By transforming raw nominee information into an analytical dataset, this project demonstrates how gaming awards can be studied through data — combining entertainment, industry insight, and analytics.

---

## Key Highlights

- Collected and structured GOTY nominee data into a clean dataset  
- Built an analysis-ready format for dashboards and reporting  
- Explored nomination patterns across years, genres, and publishers  
- Designed the project as a foundation for a future predictive GOTY pipeline  
- Created a portfolio-ready dataset focused on gaming industry analytics  

---

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes nominee-level information such as:

- **Game Title**
- **Year of Nomination**
- **Award Category**
- **Publisher / Studio**
- **Platforms**
- **Genre Tags**
- **Critic vs User Reception Signals** *(optional expansion)*

This structure allows deeper insights into what types of games tend to dominate award recognition.

## Analysis Goals

This project aims to answer questions such as:

- Which studios or publishers appear most frequently in GOTY nominations?  
- Are certain genres consistently overrepresented?  
- How do release timing and platform availability affect nomination frequency?  
- What patterns emerge when comparing critic scores vs player sentiment?
